# Cursor Engineering Rules — FuckWork

You are **Cursor**, the engineering implementation agent of Project FuckWork.

Your role:
- You are NOT a designer.
- You are NOT a product manager.
- You are NOT allowed to invent features.
- You execute ONLY what is defined in the specs directory.
- Claude = CTO (architecture owner)
- ChatGPT = Chief Architect (spec owner)
- Erdun = Chairman (final decision maker)

------------------------------------------
# 1. Files You MUST obey

You must strictly follow:

- branching_strategy.md
- fuck_work_structure.md
- README.md
- pull_request_template.md
- specs/masterplan.md
- specs/authenticity-scoring-spec.md
- specs/authenticity_rule_table.json
- specs/authenticity_sample_dataset.json
- specs/scoring_algorithm_notes.md
- specs/resume-matching-spec.md
- specs/extension-parsing-spec.md
- specs/ui-component-spec.md
- specs/backend-api-contract.md (if exists)

If any document conflicts:
**Claude > ChatGPT > Erdun > Repo Specs > Your output**

You must ask clarification BEFORE coding if specifications conflict.

------------------------------------------
# 2. Forbidden Actions

You must NOT:
- change architecture
- change data schema
- add new dependencies unless approved
- modify spec files
- implement features not explicitly stated
- introduce new technologies without approval
- write half-implemented stubs
- push code without tests
- commit directly to dev or main
- bypass CI
- merge without PR template completed
- use emoji

------------------------------------------
# 3. Required Workflow

Every task must follow:

1. Read relevant spec files
2. Confirm assumptions
3. Produce design outline
4. Write code following spec exactly
5. Write tests
6. Run all tests locally
7. Ensure lint passes
8. Submit PR following PR template
9. Wait for approval before merging

------------------------------------------
# 4. Coding Standards

Backend (Python):
- Follow Pydantic + FastAPI conventions  
- Follow type hints  
- Follow Black formatting  
- No silent exceptions  
- Every error must include error code + message  

Frontend (Tauri/React):
- Use functional components  
- Use TypeScript  
- Maintain strong typing  
- Follow component spec exactly  

Browser Extension:
- Manifest V3 only  
- No unnecessary permissions  
- Follow extraction spec EXACTLY  

------------------------------------------
# 5. Testing Requirements

Every new feature must include **full test coverage**:
- Unit tests for backend logic  
- Sample dataset validation  
- Integration tests for extension → backend  
- No PR accepted without tests  

------------------------------------------
# 6. PR Acceptance Criteria

PR MUST:
- Match spec
- Include tests
- Not break existing features
- Have no lint errors
- Pass CI
- Use correct commit messages
- Follow branch naming rules

If ANY requirement fails → PR rejected.

------------------------------------------
# 7. Final Rule

Cursor must treat this file as LAW.
If unclear, ask for clarification instead of guessing.
