# Dependency Approval Rules

Cursor MUST NOT add ANY dependency unless:

1. The dependency is listed in specs/dependency-whitelist.json
2. OR the Chairman/CTO explicitly instructs in the PR description.

Forbidden examples:
- Backend: sqlalchemy, redis, celery, pandas
- Frontend: redux, zustand, mui, chakra-ui, tailwindcss, axios
- Extension: lodash, moment.js

Allowed defaults:
- Backend: dependencies in requirements.txt ONLY.
- Desktop App: react, vite, tauri ONLY.
- Extension: esbuild or webpack if spec requires.

If dependency missing → Cursor must ask.
If unsure → Cursor must ask.
