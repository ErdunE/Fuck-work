# Spec Drift Guard

Cursor must NEVER modify:
- project architecture
- directory layout
- data models
- naming conventions
- config formats
- scoring algorithms
- API semantics

If Cursor *believes* the spec has problems →
Cursor must STOP and ask ChatGPT (Chief Architect).

Self-refactoring is strictly forbidden.
