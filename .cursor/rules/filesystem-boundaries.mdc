# Cursor Filesystem Boundary Rules

You must NOT create any new top-level directories besides:

- apps/
- specs/
- tests/
- .github/
- .cursor/
- scripts/ (only if explicitly requested)

Inside apps/:
- apps/backend/** → Python FastAPI only
- apps/desktop_app/** → Tauri + React only
- apps/browser_extension/** → Chrome MV3 only

Forbidden directories:
- src/
- src-tauri/ (unless inside desktop_app)
- services/
- utils/
- helpers/
- components/ outside desktop_app/src/
- api/ (backend only inside apps/backend)
- scripts/ (unless instructed)

Cursor MUST obey the structure defined in fuck_work_structure.md.
